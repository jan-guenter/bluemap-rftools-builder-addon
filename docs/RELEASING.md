# Release procedure

Releases are promoted only from an owner-accepted, independently audited
commit on `main`. The accepted candidate identity is recorded in
`provenance/release.json`.

## Clean gate

Use Java 21, Gradle 9.6.1, the exact sibling BlueMap checkout, and the exact
local RFToolsBuilder artifact:

```bash
gradle --no-daemon \
  -PrftoolsBuilderJar=/absolute/path/rftoolsbuilder-1.21-7.0.5.jar \
  -PreleaseTag=v0.1.0-alpha.1 \
  clean check build generatePomFileForAddonPublication \
  generateMetadataFileForAddonPublication verifyPublicationArtifacts \
  verifyReleaseCandidate
```

Inspect the production and sources JARs. Reject NeoForge metadata, nested
JARs, upstream classes/assets, gallery output, tests, research data, or
unexpanded metadata.

## Runtime and publication

Run the deterministic [gallery](../gallery/README.md) against that exact JAR,
open the intended BlueMap link for the required lightweight sanity check, and
obtain explicit owner acceptance. The accepted synthetic fixture does not
prove natural saved-NBT behavior or exact-client renderer parity. Do not
substitute a functional rebuild afterward. All accepted entry bytes are frozen;
only the recorded final-version manifest transition is permitted. Release JAR
entries use ZIP `STORED` compression to make the surrounding archive bytes
independent of host deflate implementations.

Before tagging, merge the independently audited release pull request. Create
and push an annotated `v<addon_version>` tag at that reviewed `main` commit.
The release workflow reproduces every accepted byte, creates a draft
prerelease, uploads and attests the assets, publishes the Maven package,
verifies the draft assets, and only then makes the prerelease public.

Never reuse or move a release tag. A failed prepublication run may be resumed
with the workflow's exact immutable tag input while its GitHub release remains
a draft. Publication deploys nothing to the Minecraft server.
